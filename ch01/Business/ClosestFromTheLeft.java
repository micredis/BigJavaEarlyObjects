/* Suppose you received a loyalty promotion that lets you purchase one item, valued
up to $100, from an online catalog. You want to make the best of the offer. You have
a list of all items for sale, some of which are less than $100, some more. Write an
algorithm to produce the item that is closest to $100. If there is more than one such
item, list them all. Remember that a computer will inspect one item at a time––it
can’t just glance at a list and find the best one.
